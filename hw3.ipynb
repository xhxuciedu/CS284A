Each such element has a target label 0 or 1, indicating whether the TF binds to that segment or not. The data also includes a weight per input element, since there are only a few binding sites (0.42%), so that you'd obtain an accuracy of 99.58% just by predicting there are no binding sites. This means you have to use the weights to discount the losses for label 0 and enhance the losses for label 1 items. Finally, there is an array of values, one per input element, that also indicates the chromosome accessibility for that segment.\n",
